ðŸš€ Keylogger in Action! ðŸš€

Just wrapped up an exciting projectâ€”a Python-based Keylogger! This project was a deep dive into cybersecurity and Python programming, helping me understand keystroke logging, file handling, and automation.

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
<br>
âœ… Python â€“ Core programming language
<br>
âœ… Pynput Library â€“ Capturing keystrokes efficiently
<br>
âœ… PyCharm â€“ Code editor for seamless development
<br>
âœ… File Handling â€“ Storing logs in a text file

ðŸ’¡ Knowledge Gained:
<br>
ðŸ”¹ How keyloggers work in real-world cybersecurity (both ethically & unethically)
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Understanding keyboard event listeners in Python
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Working with file handling & logging mechanisms
<br>
ðŸ”¹ Strengthened debugging skills and real-time keystroke capture

ðŸš€ Next Steps?
<br>
ðŸ”¸ Enhancing the project with encryption for log files
<br>
ðŸ”¸ Implementing email alerts for real-time monitoring
<br>
ðŸ”¸ Creating a GUI-based keylogger dashboard

Cybersecurity is a vast field, and projects like this keep the learning curve exciting! If you're interested in security and ethical hacking, this is a great way to start!
